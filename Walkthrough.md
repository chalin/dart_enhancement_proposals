Let's say Kate has an idea improve the Dart language. Here's how she goes about it. From here on out, "she" refers to Kate, and "we" refers to the DEP committee.

Here's the short version of the steps she takes:

1. Kate starts an informal discussion on the [`core-dev@dartlang.org`][core-dev]
   mailing list.
2. She creates a new repo for her DEP containing the proposal (based on our
   [template][]), tests, prototype, examples, docs, etc.
3. When she's ready for us to see it, she [files an issue][issue] pointing to a
   commit in her repo, asking us to take a look.
4. We take that issue and label it "awaiting review".
5. We review the proposal and other artifacts in the repo. We give feedback by
   filing issues on her repo.
6. We add a comment on the issue she filed saying, "we're done reviewing" and
   change the label to "awaiting for revision".
7. When she's done responding to the issues we filed, she comments on the issue
   again.
8. We set it back to "awaiting review" and go to step 5.
9. If she bails or we think it can't move forward, we may explain why, and
   close the issue.
10. If we're happy with it, we create a new directory under
    [`Accepted/`][accepted] in our repo with the full text of her proposal. We
    close the bug as ["accepted"][accepted issues].
11. At this point, the team can start implementing it (under a flag) and we can
    pass it on to TC 52.

Here's the longer story:

## Conception

Kate keeps running into some problem in her Dart code. She asks around on the
[main mailing list][misc] and [StackOverflow][] but no one seems to have a good
solution or workaround. Eventually, she has an idea for a solution that
requires a change to Dart itself. The next thing she does is send an email to
[`core-dev@dartlang.org`][core-dev].

[misc]: https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!forum/misc
[stackoverflow]: http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart

She discusses it with the folks thereâ€”people both on the Dart team and off.
Many ideas will die here, which is good. Lots of problems already have good
solutions or maybe the solution is just infeasible. If people seem to think the
idea has merit and is worth pursuing, she goes to the next step:

## Proposal

She **creates a new Git repo**, likely on GitHub, but all that matters is that
it's somewhere public. That repo has a structure something much like:

    proposal.md  # DEP doc.
    spec.tex     # Language spec changes, if any.
    test/        # Language tests.
    prototype/   # Implementation.
    example/     # Examples of using the proposal.

The proposal itself is a [Markdown][] document that she creates by copying
[our template][template] and filling it in.

[markdown]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown

In addition to the above, there may be other stuff in the repo too. Whatever
supporting artifacts she thinks are helpful. The repo is basically a little
product in itself. She can collaborate with other people, talk about it, take
pull requests and issues, whatever she wants. It's a living, breathing
workspace.

She probably *won't* have actual proposed spec language changes, at least not
initially. The set of people who can write that kind of stuff correctly is very
small. Fortunately, we have a few on staff, so as Kate's proposal reaches
maturity, we can help fill this in. Of course, she's welcome to work on it too.
It's her proposal, after all.

When she decides the proposal document and other artifacts (mainly the tests
and prototype) are ready for the committee to see, she **gets our attention by
filing an [issue][]** on the [dart_enhancement_proposals repo][dep repo].

[dep repo]: https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals

We'll provide a template for that issue that's basically:

    Note to others: please do not comment on the proposal in this issue.
    Instead, file issues on the proposal's repo.

    Hi, I have a proposal to enhance Dart. Its repo is: <repo>
    Please look at commit <commit hash>.

We call this the **tracking issue.** It stays open as long as her DEP is
in-progress. It's the canonical identifier for her DEP. Its [label][] defines
the current status of the DEP.

[label]: https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals/labels

## Admission

We (probably [Bob][]) see that issue has come in. We label it "pending review".
At this point, it's a live DEP and it's our turn to review it.

## Review

In a timely manner, we **review the proposal** and the other stuff in the repo.
We can do this individually, in meetings, whatever. We **provide feedback to
her by filing issues in her proposal's repo**.

Instead of her *pulling* feedback from us in something like a pull request to
our repo, we *push* feedback to her as issues. When we're done doing that, we:

* Add a comment on the tracking issue saying we're done reviewing.
* Change its label to "awaiting revision".

## Revision

Filing a bunch of separate issues for unrelated pieces of feedback lets her
manage responding to them individually. It lets other people also contribute
and comment on the issues as well. She can label them, triage them, fix them,
etc.

We can contribute in other ways too. We may send her pull requests if we want
to actively chip in. Meanwhile, she controls what actually lands so she doesn't
have to worry about us hijacking her proposal.

Other people can send her patches and pull requests. She can make commits to
her repo use branches, whatever she wants while she's revising things. This is
*much* more flexible than something like a single pull request for the lifetime
of the proposal.

Once she's happy that she's addressed all of the issues, she **comments on the
tracking issue** saying, "OK, please check it out again." She mentions the
commit that is the snapshot she wants us to consider.

We go through the review cycle again.

## Acceptance

Eventually, if things go well, we get to a point where we don't have any more
feedback to give. We have a commit that points to a version of the proposal,
spec changes, tests, and prototype implementation that we are happy to pass
along to TC 52. At that point we:

* Label the tracking bug "accepted" and close it.
* Copy the contents of her repo at the commit we accepted into
  [dart_enhancement_proposals][dep repo] under
  [`Accepted/<number>/...`][accepted].

Now, the proposal has exited the DEP process and moves into the more official
Ecma standardization process. If we've done our job well, the proposal will
satisfy the committee and will get ratified pretty much as-is.

However, the TC 52 committee always has final say over what makes it into the
standard and there is a chance the proposal will be modified or possibly even
rejected. Our goal with the DEP process is to make sure the proposals we
deliver are so great that they slide right in and everyone is happy.
