Best effort attempt at writing down changes needed in the language specification.(link to current spec?)

## Patents rights
TC52, the Ecma technical committee working on evolving the open [Dart standard](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-408.htm), operates under a royalty-free patent policy, [RFPP](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC52%20policy/Ecma%20Experimental%20TC52%20Royalty-Free%20Patent%20Policy.pdf).
